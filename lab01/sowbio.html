            I am currently studying Information Management & Technology in the iSchool with interests in software development. Recently I have developed a strong interest in website development and debugging especially for businesses with/that need a website. I have coding experience in Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, and Java. Outside of work, I love to spend my day being active or trying new things. On a regular day, you could find me working out in the gym and playing basketball. If not though, you would probably find me outside trying to do something new.
