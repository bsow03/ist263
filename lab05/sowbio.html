            <h2> Personal Info</h2>
            <p> I am currently studying Information Management & Technology in the iSchool with interests in <strong> software development </strong>. Recently I have developed a strong interest in <strong> website development </strong> and debugging especially for businesses with/that need a website. I have coding experience in a variety of different coding languages which will be listed below. Outside of work, I love to spend my day being active or trying new things. On a regular day, you could find me working out in the gym and playing basketball. If not though, you would probably find me outside trying to do something new. </p>
